## Announcement (13/4/2025)

I am happy to announce that the app to run the SETAR model from my previous paper <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00362-023-01472-7> (Active-set based block coordinate descent algorithm in group LASSO for self-exciting threshold autoregressive model) is now available online: <https://statsappumk.shinyapps.io/TAR-GLASSO/>. More features to be added soon.
