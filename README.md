## Announcement (29/1/2026)

I am happy to announce that the app to run the SETAR model from my previous paper <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00362-023-01472-7> (Active-set based block coordinate descent algorithm in group LASSO for self-exciting threshold autoregressive model) is now available online: <https://umk-jaffri-nasir-tar-glasso.share.connect.posit.cloud/>.

Simulated dataset are available [HERE](https://github.com/jaffrinasir/Algorithms/tree/master/1.%20Block%20Coordinate%20Descent%20(BCD)%2C%20Single%20Line%20Search%20(SLS)%20and%20Group%20Least%20Angle%20Regression%20(GLAR)%20for%20SETAR/For%20Posit%20Shiny)

I am also happy to announce that our GARCH with Adaptive LASSO penalty from my previous paper <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00180-025-01642-1> (ACoordinate gradient descent algorithm in adaptive LASSO for pure ARCH and pure GARCH models) is now available as a Posit Shiny app : <https://umk-jaffri-nasir-garch-cgd.share.connect.posit.cloud/>.
